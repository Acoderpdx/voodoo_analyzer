# GitHub Push Commands
# After creating the repo on GitHub, use these commands:

# 1. Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/voodoo_analyzer.git

# 2. Rename branch to main (GitHub default)
git branch -M main

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# If you get authentication errors, you may need to:
# - Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
# - Or use SSH: git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/voodoo_analyzer.git

# To check your remotes:
git remote -v

# To see all your commits:
git log --oneline
